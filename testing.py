# How many people happened to ask for loans worth less than 2000?

# If people in the data were unemployed, what are important features for predicting credit risk?
# How likely are the people older than 30 to be good credit risk?
# Which three features are the most important for the model's predictions in the data?
# Assuming that the age of unemployment is decreased by 5 years, what would the prediction be?
# Are people younger than 25 vulnerable to bad credit risk?
